        <p>
          The ceaser cipher is the simplest and oldest method of cryptography.
          The Caesar cipher method is based on a mono-alphabetic cipher and is
          also called a shift cipher or additive cipher. Julius Caesar used the
          shift cipher (additive cipher) technique to communicate with his
          officers. For this reason, the shift cipher technique is called the
          Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a kind of replacement
          (substitution) cipher, where all letter of plain text is replaced by
          another letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's take an example to understand the Caesar cipher, suppose we are
          shifting with 1, then A will be replaced by B, B will be replaced by
          C, C will be replaced by D, D will be replaced by C, and this process
          continues until the entire plain text is finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caesar ciphers is a weak method of cryptography. It can be easily
          hacked. It means the message encrypted by this method can be easily
          decrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plain Text:</strong>
          It is a simple message written by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cipher Text:</strong>
          It is an encrypted message after applying some technique.
